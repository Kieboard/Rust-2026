🌍 Rust: 2026

Your Year in Rust — Community Edition

A community-made year-in-review experience for Rust players, inspired by Spotify Wrapped.
This project turns publicly available player activity into a fun, visual recap of your year in Rust.

Built using public and opt-in data only, with a focus on transparency and accuracy.

✨ What is this?

Rust: 2026 gives players a personalized summary of their year in Rust —
where they played, how long they survived, and what kind of player they were.

This is not an official Facepunch product.
It’s a fan-made project built to celebrate the Rust community.
